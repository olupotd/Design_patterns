A repository for deisign patterns software work
This is a readme file for a java chat application that allows all users to universally chat together. It's functionalities are 
	-> Allows a user to signup and send chat messages to all online users.
	->lets a connected user know who has joined or left the chatroom
	->allows a user to read messages depending on the number it came in at for 		  example i can request for the first message sent ever by clicking on the getLog 	    button and typing in 1. This retrives the first message ever registered on the 		  system.

to run the files, run the jar files like this
Open Terminal and type in.
>>java -jar server_file.jar  
>>Server started.
This above should be the ouput of the command. This starts up the server application listening on port 8008. Then run the client
>>java client_file.jar

This creates a dialog asking for your username. Enter any name to identify you then press enter. Another one pops up asking for a storage technology type. Options supported are csv, xml and sqlite but you should have sqlite installed otherwise just pick one of the other two. 

An Example is:
douglas  #for the username and
xml      #for the storage technology


One more thing. Try to run atleast two client to notice the chat application work.
